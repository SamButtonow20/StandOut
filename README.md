## Handling Secrets and Git History

If you accidentally committed sensitive files like `.env` containing API keys, follow these steps to safely remove them from your Git history.

### Using BFG Repo-Cleaner

1. Download the [BFG jar file](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.14.0/bfg-1.14.0.jar).

2. Run the following command from your repository root:

   ```bash
   java -jar path/to/bfg.jar --delete-files .env
   ```

3. Clean up your Git repository:

   ```bash
   git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   git gc --prune=now --aggressive
   ```

4. Force push your cleaned history:

   ```bash
   git push origin main --force
   ```

### Important Notes

* Removing files from history rewrites commits. Be sure to coordinate with collaborators.
* After removing secrets, add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to prevent future commits.
